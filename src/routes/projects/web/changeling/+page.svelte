	In the summer of 2023, I led a mid-size web development team at
	<a href="https://www.changelingvr.com/" target="_blank">ChangelingVR</a>. As my first leadership
	role in a professional setting, I initially faced a steep learning curve. Fortunately, I was
	blessed with a positive work environment where I could rely on my boss's guidance and my team's
	feedback. With their help, I quickly got on my feet. This experience taught me the value of open
	leadership.
